</div>

<p>The object of this little book is to give to builders a few practical
hints that can be used in their endeavors to erect a home that
is proposed to be durable, comfortable and healthy. They are
susceptible of being improved to an extent that will meet the wishes
of the most extravagant builder, or simplified to suit purse and
requirements of a builder with moderate means.</p>

<p>We have left out generalities, and offer the reader solid facts
that are valuable to every one engaged in the ever pleasant task of
constructing a home.</p>

<h1>Practical Hints to Builders.</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE ARCHITECT.</h2>

</div>

<p>Shall we employ one? Yes, if the work is sufficiently important
to justify it, and it is a very modest house indeed that is not.</p>

<p>As the professional architect is generally a graduate of one of
the building trades, and has gravitated to that position because of
his peculiar fitness for it, it stands to reason, some will think, that
from among the many builders one can be selected who is capable
of taking the contract and presiding as architect. To such persons
we would say: You are not familiar with the functions of an architect,
when considered separate from the builder. The architect can
save you money. He discovers your wants, your likes, and your
dislikes; he reduces them to a tangible form; he draws up the
specifications so minutely that every variety of material and labor is
distinctly set forth as to its quality and kind.</p>

<p>When completed, plans and specifications are presented to a
builder for an estimate; he knows exactly what is expected of him.
There is no chance for controversy or quibble; all has been settled
by the owner through his architect. In consequence, if several contractors
estimate upon the building, it is known that their figures are
all upon the same basis.</p>

<p>We will say in general he can save you from five to twenty per
cent. in cost; will give you better construction and proportions, and
add a value to your house, apart from its first cost, that if it does
not sell for more, it will sell more readily than if built without
his service.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SELECTING A BUILDING SITE.</h2>

</div>

<p>There are but few persons who are in a position to locate their
proposed home just where they would most desire it. But, fortunately,
most any building site is capable of being made to look well,
it the style of architecture selected harmonizes with the surroundings.</p>

<p>It is of the first importance that the location be a healthy one.
Better rent all your life than ignore that. Avoid the neighborhood
of swamps and stagnant water, or where the cellar, (if you have one)
to your house, from the nature of the location, will be damp. Large
bodies of water, or running water is never unhealthy; but on the
contrary, it is in many ways conducive to health. Some very uninviting,
rugged and neglected spots, can, with but little expense and
an appropriate building, be made exceedingly beautiful.</p>

<p>One of the prettiest school-houses I ever saw was built on a lot
given by a farmer for a district school. It did look as if the piece
of ground was worthless for any purpose; it was rocky, overgrown
with briers and bushes, and a tiny stream ran across the lot, jumping
from rock to rock, alongside of which, on a level spot but little
larger than room for a building, a house with steep roof and turret
was built, and the adjacent hillside made a splendid study and playground
for the scholars. When completed the building and grounds
was a model of what a country school-house should be.</p>

<p>While an elevation is at all times desirable, a hill is not. The
exposure to the storms in winter, and the tiresome walk in summer,
is to be avoided. A few native trees, if on the ground to furnish
shade, are desirable. The water supply, too, is to be considered.
Most architects say a Southern exposure is the best, but this depends
on your location. For Southern homes the East is preferable.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak">FOUNDATION.</h2>

</div>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus03.jpg" width="200" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>Just how deep to excavate to start the foundation
of a house depends on the climate and
soil. Always dig trenches below the frost line in
any soil. This is sufficient if the subsoil is solid;
if the subsoil is not solid, go deep enough to
reach solid earth.</p>

<p>In saying this, we are supposing you
are not building in a swamp, where it is
often necessary to drive piles upon which
to start a solid foundation. Stone is generally
used for foundation walls where it is convenient, and it makes
the best. Hard pressed brick, laid with mortar composed of one
part of hydraulic lime and two parts sharp sand, makes a foundation
not inferior to stone for all practical purposes. By using the above
mortar, dampness will not ascend from the ground to injure the floor
joists.</p>

<p>Mortar made from common lime or sand, though commonly
used, is objectionable for foundations, because dampness will ascend
even above the floor joists, if the floor is not several feet above the
ground. It is often the case that hydraulic lime cannot be conveniently
had. In that case a layer of slate or coarse paper, well saturated
with pitch, laid between the brick seams below the line of joists,
will answer the same purpose, and is less expensive.</p>

<p>See that the space between the joists is filled with brick, flush
with the under-side of floor boards. This prevents Mr. Rat, or
other members of his interesting family, from sitting in these little
corners and gnawing into the room above, or climbing between the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
siding to the upper floors. If this little matter is attended to right,
neither rats or mice can enter the house, except through the doors.
To keep them from burrowing underneath the foundation walls, let
the thickness of one brick project outward at the bottom of the
foundation. On burrowing downward, a rat soon reaches this shelf,
and following it around till he arrives at the place he started from,
becomes disgusted, or is supposed to, as he is not seen about the
house again. It is always better to have the foundation broader at
the bottom than the thickness of wall intended to be used. This is
necessary in all brick houses, unless on a rock bottom.</p>

<p>See that the space under the ground floor is left clear of rubbish
before the floor is laid, and grating built in the wall for ventilation.
This opening can be closed in winter to secure additional warmth.
The cellar is closely related to the foundation; we give some hints
on its construction on <a href="#Page_22">page 22</a>.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">COLORS.—For Exterior and Interior.</h2>

</div>

<p>As your house nears completion, it is well to decide upon colors.
That is a distinctive feature which is to give tone and beauty, and
make your house in some respects different from all others. The
question of painting is often a mere matter of preserving the structure,
and not a question of beauty or harmony of colors, or what
would be best suited to the surroundings; it is too often the case
that but little regard is paid to those nice perceptions that make one
man’s work many times more valuable than another. Strong contrasts
of color should be avoided. Light tints are preferable to
strong colors. Think of a house painted black, red, yellow, or green.</p>

<p>Let the surroundings suggest what the exterior colors should be.
A house surrounded by trees and shrubbery will admit of white, with
white tinted trimmings, such as cornices, corner-boards, window and
door frames; but for half the year the green foliage of the trees is
turned to brown, which but partially relieves the glaring white. This
is why that color is not a favorite for exteriors. As a rule, select a
light color for the body of the house, and darken that for the
trimmings.</p>

<p>For interior wood-work select light wood colors; let none be
darker than walnut. Oak, chestnut, ash, white walnut, maple and
cherry make a beautiful finish by simply oiling, and varnishing if a
gloss is preferred. Very light shades of ochre make beautiful ceilings
which can be ornamented with suitable designs, using darker
but delicate shades of other light colors. Here is where the taste
and skill of the painter comes in, and unless you are an adept, don’t
fail to consult an experienced decorator for your inside walls.</p>

<p>For houses of moderate cost we think nothing is equal to solid
colors for inside walls. Let the colors be light and cheerful, and
the rooms of different shades. (<a href="#Page_48">See page 48</a>).</p>

<p>If you are interested in <i>Roofing</i>, send
for our Price List and Discount Sheet,
which is special to the trade. We are
pioneers in the introduction of practical
metal shingles, and no imitator has yet
produced their equal. Our goods are
largely used throughout the United
States and Canadas; are used by the
Government and Railroads; approved
by the Fire Insurance Companies, and
many leading Architects and Builders.
They are lighter than slate, and will last
longer without repairs; and the low rate
of insurance on our roofing will, in a
short time, more than balance the difference
in price where wood shingles
are cheaper.</p>

<p>As seen by the cut, our shingles are the
same to-day as when first introduced.
Remember, no cleats or springs are necessary
in using our shingles. The lock
is simple and perfect, with corrugations
across the top, and bracing corrugations
across the exposed end of the shingles,
which stiffen and hold the shingles
firmly to the underlying courses. They
are easily applied, and any one who can
lay a wood shingle can lay these. We
furnish them in four sizes, made from charcoal
roofing tin, painted both sides and unpainted,
galvanized tin plate, which is superior
to galvanized iron, cold rolled copper,
and steel plates. We keep on hand a full
line of roofing sundries.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">ROOF VALLEYS OR GUTTERS.</h2>

</div>

<p>It is generally known to builders and roofers that the greatest
amount of wear upon all kinds of roofs is in the valleys or gutters.
Therefore, that part of the roof, whether covered with slate, tin or
wood shingles, should be of the best material, and free from the
annoying possibility of cracking.</p>

<p>This trouble is always caused by expansion and contraction of
the metal. The usual method is to make the valley of the desired
length, and, after shaping to the roof-boards, to nail each side firmly.
The result is, with the summer heat, a buckle is often formed at
some point between the two ends. In cold weather the buckle draws
out, and in course of time, if the joints in the middle do not give
way, a leak will appear, caused by the metal cracking. This will
not occur with our roof valleys, because we amply provide for the
expansion and contraction of the same. We particularly call the
attention of dealers in building material to our Queen Anne Valley.
It is salable, durable and cheap, always ready to apply; can be used
by any workman capable of laying slate, tin or wood shingles. (<a href="#Page_23">See

<h2 class="nobreak">WHAT IS GOOD MORTAR?</h2>

</div>

<p>To a casual observer mortar is mud, but to a builder who understands
the chemistry of mortar it is a compound of water, lime and
sand, and when properly prepared forms an indestructible cement.
Fresh slacked lime, when brought in contact with clean, sharp sand,
adheres strongly to the surface of each grain, and forms the silicate
of lime.</p>

<p>At the same time the drying mortar absorbs carbonic acid from
the atmosphere, forming with it lime-stone, which in time becomes a
rock in solidity. Now, all mortar is good or bad in proportion to
the purity of the ingredients and their relative affinity for each
other. The adhesive properties of mortar are nullified by loam or
clay in sand, or the stale condition of lime used.</p>

<p>Loam mortar adheres freely to the surface of walls or ceilings.
So does mud if thrown against an upright surface; but water dissolves
it. It dries quickly, but does not harden with age. The foundation
of many frame, and the entire walls of many brick houses are built
with poor mortar, when the materials for good could be had at the
same price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span></p>

<p>Water, lime, sand and hair are the ingredients for plasterers’
mortar in about the following proportions: One bushel unslacked
lime and four bushels sharp sand; (to this add twenty-four pounds
of dry hair for every one hundred yards, when used for “scratch” or
first coat,) and water sufficient to make it of proper consistency. After
being properly mixed, the mortar should stand from three to ten days
before using. However, the time it should stand depends upon the
susceptibility of the lime to slack. Some lime requires a month,
while good lime slacks immediately. Age improves mortar, provided
it is kept wet, and makes it work easier under the workman’s trowel.
As it is the keys formed by pressing the mortar against the lathing
on the ceiling that holds it to its place, there should be a relative
width of lath and key space to insure strength sufficient to prevent
its falling. Ignorance of this, and poor mortar, is the cause of falling
ceilings. Lath one inch wide, 7/16 inches thick, placed 7/16 inches apart
will insure good strong work.</p>

<p>The second coat needs but a very small quantity of hair. Fifty
bushels sand, and twelve and one-half bushels unslacked lime, will
make mortar enough to cover one hundred square yards. If mortar
freezes before it is dry it loses its cementing properties and becomes
in common phase rotten, but if the sand used is clean, and it remains
frozen without thawing until it is dry, it is not injured. The
best way to treat a house in which the plastering is not dry, and cannot
be kept from freezing before it dries, is to throw the house open,
and let it freeze for eight or ten days, or until the plastering freezes dry.</p>

<p>Cisterns should be plastered inside with mortar made of equal
parts of hydraulic lime and clean sand. For brick work above foundations
use one part unslacked lime to four parts sand.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">TO ARCHITECTS AND BUILDERS.</h2>

</div>

<p>There is no detail of house building more important than the
roof. Upon it depends to a great degree the durability and preservation
of the whole structure. The number of good houses with mottled
ceilings and cracked plastering, to be seen all over the country,
are reminders of the necessity of securing the best material and
faultless construction for this important part of your dwelling.</p>

<p>The advantages we claim for our Tin Shingle, over the ordinary
mode of applying sheet metal for roofing purposes, consists in its
<b>Superior Strength, Freedom from Wrinkles and Cracking</b>,
(which cannot at all times be prevented where sheet metal is put on
in continuous sheets); and in being the <b>Most Ornamental and
Durable</b> of all sheet metal roof coverings. Now, in answer to this
last assertion you may say, How can this be? Is not the same
quality of tin as durable when applied in one form as another?
We answer, By no means. The writer—and we presume the reader—has
seen tin roofs worked, and walked over in the necessary finishing
up, to such an extent as to seriously damage the roof. The Tin
Roofers’ mallets, seamers, tongs, and sliding over the roof, do more
real damage to the surface of tin plate than several years’ wear. We
entirely overcome this difficulty, as no part of the exposed surface of
our Tin Shingles are struck with a mallet or hammer in applying
them. Again, where metal plates are put together in continuous
sheets, moisture, which condenses underneath for want of ventilation,
settles in the cross-seams and causes decay, and the ordinary metal
roof when removed invariably shows this to be the case, while the
other part of the plate shows no perceptible wear. Our form of
metal roofing has no cross-seams, and has sufficient ventilation to
prevent the condensation of moisture underneath, making it by many
years the most durable form of metal roofing ever offered to the
American people.</p>

<p>Our object is to furnish the building public with a better form
of roofing material, attractive in appearance, without the objections
of the heavy slate, the clumsy shingle, or the plain ribbed metal roof;
and at a price that claims the attention of Architects and Builders of
the whole country.</p>

</div>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus13.jpg" width="175" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We will not moralize on the evils of
smoky chimneys, but just tell you in plain
language how to construct them so they will
not smoke. Make the throat of the fire-place
not more than half the size of the flue;
carefully smooth the inside of the flue, and
have it of the same area all the way to near
the top of the chimney, when it should be
gradually tapered inward to about half the
area of the flue. At the extreme top, the
cap stone should slant from the opening in all directions downward
at an angle of about twenty degrees. This will insure a good
draught and prevent the smoke blowing downward. No two fire-places
should enter the same flue; neither should a stove-pipe enter
a flue unless the fire-place is closed. Each stove and fire-place
should have its own flue. The size necessary for a flue depends on
the fuel to be used.</p>

<p>Soft or Bituminous coal requires a flue nearly double the size of
one where Anthracite is to be used; an open fire-place for wood,
larger flues than either. For instance, an 8 × 8 inch flue answers for
Anthracite, because it makes but little soot, while if Bituminous coal
is used, 8 × 12 is none too large.</p>

<p>You will find in houses all over the country flues smaller than
the above, and a corresponding number of smoky chimneys, which it
is impossible to remedy without re-building from the bottom up.</p>

<p>The carelessness displayed in chimney construction is astonishing.
As the work is hid from view on completion, be watchful during
the process of construction from the ground up. All chimneys
should, if possible, extend above the apex or comb of roof, and
should be built of good hard burnt brick, and no woodwork should
be allowed to enter within five inches of inside of flue, and not
within twelve inches anywhere near the fire-place.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE WALTER’S PATENT, AND WHAT IT IS.</h2>

</div>

<p>Previous to the granting of a patent to John Walter, in 1882, there
were no tin shingles manufactured for the trade in the United States,
with the exception of those which covered more than two-thirds of
their surface to get one-third exposed to the weather; the same is
commonly done with wood shingles. This made them too expensive
for general use. The Walter’s patent made it practical to expose five-sixths
of the surface and only conceal one-sixth of the shingle. This
great saving at once reduced the cost of metal shingles over one-half,
and enabled the National Sheet Metal Roofing Co., which controls
this patent, to put on the market the best metal roofing in the world,
at prices that compete with ordinary wood shingles. (See “Comparative
Cost,” <a href="#Page_26">pages 26 and 27</a>.)</p>

<p>How this was done is best expressed in the claim granted the
patentee, copied from the United States Official Gazette:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A metal roofing plate having a gutter formed by corrugations at one side,
and a perforated flange at the side of the gutter, whereby it shall be
nailed to the roof of a house; a broad corrugation at the other side
adapted to form a seam with the adjoining edge of a corresponding
plate, substantially as shown and described.”</p>

</div>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illus16.jpg" width="700" height="85" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The advantage of this lock is that it makes a water-tight seam
without soldering or hammering down. The plates are joined as
easy as crossing two sticks, with ample provision for expansion and
contraction. This lock is the perfection of simplicity; there is no
exposed seam where water is liable to lodge and cause rust; no cleats
are used, and no tin springs are necessary to hold the side edges of
connecting plates to prevent water seeping through.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PAINTING SHEET-METAL ROOFS.</h2>

</div>

<p>The subject of painting sheet-metal roofs is one of great importance, says
the <i>Builder, Decorator and Wood-Worker</i>, not only on account of the protection
afforded, but because the material, when properly colored, can be made pleasant
to the eye when placed in exposed positions. While many kinds of paint
have been discovered and patented, composed of a great variety of materials, it
is a question if there is a substance used that is an effective substitute for linseed
oil, regarding the effectiveness of which an authority on the subject says:
“By consulting experienced and unbiased painters you will learn the fact that
there is no vehicle pigments at all approaching linseed oil in effectiveness and
durability, especially for exposure to the weather. A good paint must be both
hard and elastic. It requires hardness to prevent abrasion and wear, and elasticity
to prevent cracking from expansion and contraction. Nothing but linseed
oil will give these qualities, for, strange as it may seem to many in these days of
novelties, the pigments really add but very little to the effectiveness of paints.
Mark, we say the best of pigments, for many pigments are the reverse of protective,
and are really destructive to both the vehicles and the material which
they are supposed to protect. For example, coal tar and all its products,
whether called dead oil, asphalt, rubber, etc., are of the class just described, and
their use at any price, especially for covering sheet-metals, is a wanton waste
of money. Extended experiments have demonstrated that there is no better
pigment for metal than a good iron ore ground to an impalpable powder. To
be most thoroughly effective the pigment must be intimately incorporated with
the vehicle, which can best be done only by grinding them together in a stone
mill by steam power.” It is of the greatest importance that sheet-metal roofs,
especially those made of iron, should be protected from the action of the elements,
as when so protected there is hardly any limit to the time they will last.
In order that the paint should be effective, it should be applied before the iron
has had an opportunity to rust, and the first coat should be of the best quality
and applied in the best manner; or if it is defective it is plain that it will not
only require repainting far sooner than it should, but no matter how good the
subsequent coatings of paint are, they cannot be effective if founded on an original
coating which has commenced to crack or peel, as it certainly will if not
prepared with the best methods and materials. Another important point to be
observed in the painting of sheet-metal is that the paint should not be too thick,
as it is the linseed oil that is to be depended on to furnish protection, and as
the action of the air on the surface of the exposed oil gives it a particularly hard
surface, two thin coats of paint are much more durable than one thick one.</p>

<p>Remember, it is the <b>rust-preventing</b> qualities of linseed oil, combined
with the oxide of iron, that makes steel or iron sheets resist the corrosive action
of oxygen, which is ever present in the atmosphere. (<a href="#Page_101">See page 101.</a>)</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CELLAR.</h2>

</div>

<p>The cellar under a dwelling house has many advocates. It is a
convenient, cool place, and nineteen times out of twenty is a damp,
dark, musty, foul-smelling place. It cannot well be otherwise and
be a cellar. It is a store-room for all sorts of vegetables; odds and
ends of most everything are laid away in that dark retreat. It is the
favorite resort of spiders, toads and other creeping things; it is the
unrelenting enemy (?) of the family physician, the breeding-place of
malaria, which unceasingly sends its poisonous vapors into every part
of the dwelling above it. It would be suicide for one to make it
their sleeping room.</p>

<p>But if you insist upon having a cellar under your house, and
will not put it under the corn-crib or carriage-house, see that it is
properly constructed. This is more important than most of the
other parts of the house, for upon it in a great measure depends the
health of your entire family.</p>

<p>The floor of the cellar should be hard and dry, with no woodwork
in its construction. To obtain this result, cover the floor
about three inches deep with coarse gravel, or broken stone, well
pounded to a level surface. Fill this with a thin mortar, composed
of one part hydraulic cement and two parts sharp sand, smoothing
it off with a trowel or plasterer’s level. When we mention sharp
sand, we mean coarse, clean sand.</p>

<p>Build a flue, say 8 × 12 inches (with an opening next to the floor
of the cellar fully that size), from the bottom of cellar foundation
alongside of and extending to top of kitchen chimney, the heat of
which will create a constant, upward current of air from the cellar.
On the opposite side of cellar from this ventilating flue make an air
inlet near the ceiling for the purpose of supplying fresh air to the
cellar. This will keep the cellar dry and the atmosphere healthy.
Put a wire netting over the opening to prevent the entrance of rats
and mice. If from the nature of the location, or other causes, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
cellar is damp, dig a trench all around a little below and outside of
the foundation wall; this trench should be covered with flat stones
and earth filled in a little above the surface line, so that surface
water will flow from, and not settle next to, the foundation walls.
When the cellar is completed whitewash the walls and ceiling.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus20.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="" />
</div>

<p>We are often asked if
our metal shingles are as
cheap as wood shingles.
While we cannot consistently
say they are not; still, if
we say they are, they refer
to our price list, which
necessitates an explanation
something like this:</p>

<p>We will suppose a dwelling
is to be built to cost, say $2,500. Such a house will usually
require about 20 squares of roof covering, which, if done with wood
shingles, fixes the cost of fire insurance about one-quarter of one per
cent. higher than a metal roof during its existence. This extends
not only to the house, but all contained in such roofed houses. And
this is the case, no matter how good the wood shingles are.</p>

<p>In making this comparison, we will consider such shingles as are
generally used in the older settled portions of the country. We are
aware that shingles made from well-matured timber, straight-grained,
free from sap and wind-shakes, full length, hand drawn to five-eighths
of an inch at the butt, four inches wide, and carefully put on make a
good, durable roof. But shingles of that kind are only to be had in
the thinly settled portions of the country.</p>

<p>It is the broad, thin, split or sawed shingles, found in all markets,
which we contend are more expensive than our metal shingles.
These do not last, on an average, more than fifteen years, and after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
ten years the repairs are a continual expense until removed and replaced
with new material, which is not often done until some of the
woodwork is badly damaged, and ceiling cracked and stained from
frequent leakages. On the other hand, <i>tin shingles will last for any
length of time, if painted once in every five or six years, and show no
perceptible wear</i>.</p>

<p class="caption">(For Finials, <a href="#Page_74">see page 74</a>.)</p>
</div>

<p>A roof for your house is indispensable, and because it is so, let it
be a good one. No part of your house is subject to the same amount
of exposure, and there is no
part independent of its protection.
If you have built
for the personal comfort of
yourself and family, do not
slight the roof because cheap,
plain material is the most
convenient. There is really
no economy in doing so. It
is outside, to be sure, but,
like the chimney, it is a necessity.
As we cannot ignore
it, we must try to make
it, as a part of the house,
attractive. No money spent
on the house will add more
to its selling value than that
expended in taste and material
for the roof.</p>

<div class="figright">
<img src="images/illus22.jpg" width="300" height="250" alt="" />
</div>

<p>The difference expended in favor of good material adds to every
part of the structure. The roof is about the first thing the prospective
purchaser sees. He
cannot help it; it is right
before his eyes. His first
impressions are the hardest
to overcome.</p>

<p>A good roof must be,
first, rain-proof; second,
fire-proof; third, light in
weight; fourth, durable;
fifth, ornamental; sixth,
not liable to get out of
order. You can have your
house covered with such a
roof, and not pass the limited
boundaries of economy.</p>

<p>Read carefully the pages of this little book devoted to roofing
materials and sundries.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE KITCHEN.</h2>

</div>

<p>Somehow, our architects and builders habitually neglect to
study the requirements of the kitchen, but persist in constructing
for this use a plainly constructed room, generally cramped in size,
with no means of escaping the great heat generated by the range or
stove, which in the hot months of summer is almost unbearable. If
men were often obliged to remain in such a place, a large part of the
day during the hot season, they would be quick to seize upon any
plan which would mitigate the heat. But as their wives, daughters
or “help” preside in that department, they offer no amendment to
the long-established mode of kitchen construction.</p>

<p>Now, a kitchen can be so constructed that even with the largest
size family-stove or range in use, it will be as comfortable as any
other room in the house, and at an expense not to exceed the cost
of the stove or range used. To do this, build of brick a large open
fire-place, say from three to twelve inches broader than the length of
the stove or range to be used, and from front to rear deep enough to
receive the same. It is best to set an ordinary cook-stove with the
side to the front, so that the oven door can be convenient. The
oven door, of course, on the opposite side is permanently closed.
The range being differently constructed can readily be set in the
brick enclosure or open fire-place, the walls of which should be built
perpendicular to the floor, and about five feet high. The back wall
should be sufficiently thick to commence at this point a smoke-flue
8 × 12 inches, with an opening to receive the smoke-pipe from the
range or stove, and continue it out through the roof of house (see
“Chimneys”); resting on the walls of this open fire-place build,
either with wood or brick, a tapering flue, so that after emerging
from the roof it will expose an opening of not less than four square
feet. A cap should be put over this to prevent an entrance of rain,
but not to contract the draught space.</p>

<p>You will see by this arrangement you have a large chimney with
a fire-place at the bottom large enough to receive the stove or range.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
Now construct a sliding sash with double strength glass, and balanced
with weights, with the upper end of sash inside the draught
flue, and the lower end to reach within a foot of the floor, and about
four inches from the side of stove. You will readily perceive that
the heat from the stove inside the flue will constantly cause a strong
draught between the bottom of the sash and the floor, which will
prevent heat from escaping into the kitchen, keeping it as cool as
any room in the house. Even with the sash up, the draught will
take nearly all the heat through the flue over the stove, carrying
with it the steam and odor during the process of cooking. A coat of
whitewash inside the brick-work will add to the appearance and give
light, which is shadowed by the flue.</p>

<p>The kitchen should be large and light, and, if possible, be joined
by a broad covered porch, upon which much of the kitchen work
can be done in warm weather.</p>

<p>As this little book is merely hints to builders, we cannot go into
the details of hot and cold water, stationary wash-tubs and such
matters. But we will say, more important than all this is a well-constructed
drain pipe, not less than three inches in diameter, leading
from the kitchen sink to a point some distance (according to the
nature of the ground) from the house. This pipe inside the kitchen,
should have a trap to prevent offensive odors escaping into the
room.</p>

<p>BRONZE METAL SHINGLES.—We believe we are the first to offer Bronze
Metal Shingles to the World; certainly the first to manufacture them in the
United States. No other metal known for house covering is their equal, not
excepting copper, which in its pure state is rather soft and pliable, unless of a
weight to practically exclude its use.</p>

<p>Bronze Metal is hard, rigid and sufficiently ductile to make the most serviceable
roofing material for public and first-class private buildings in the
world. Any house designed to exist as a memorial of man’s sagacity and
thrift should be covered with these shingles. They are as enduring as marble;
they will wear for any length of time.</p>

<p>We make them in three sizes—7 by 10, 10 by 14, and Queen Anne style.
Prices furnished upon application.</p>

<p>Dear Sirs:—I was the first man in this town to cover my new house, built
last summer, with Walter’s Patent Charcoal Tin Shingles, and will say that
they have given, thus far, entire satisfaction. They are not only ornamental
but durable, and since my roof has introduced them in our town, a great many
have been put on, all giving satisfaction. I am sure that this is the material
for roofing houses in the future. They are better than any other roof now in
use, and will take the place of wood shingles, which are getting scarce, and also
of slate roofs, which are broken by storms. Mine has stood the test of the
severest storms, during the summer and winter, known here for many years, and
has proven itself what you claim it is—absolutely wind, rain and storm-proof.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">BRICK-WORK.</h2>

</div>

<p>“Brick from the run of the kiln” will answer for most houses;
those of even color, well-burnt and regular shape, should be selected
for the outside walls and chimneys. Those of irregular shape, too
hard or too soft for outside walls, can be used for filling in, or partition
walls. No soft burnt brick should be allowed where exposed
to the weather. Supposing the foundation is finished, and first-floor
joists are laid, commence by filling between joists, flush with the top
of joists and even with the inside of foundation walls, so no shelves
are left between the joists for the purpose shown in hints under the
head of “Foundation,” <a href="#Page_6">page 6</a>.</p>

<p>If the inside of outside walls are to be furred, be prepared to
insert strips about the thickness of common lath between brick joints
at points where base boards are to be put, and to fasten long strips
or grounds as called by plasterers. No mortar should be put between
the lath strip and the brick, but let the lath be pressed by the
surface of the upper and lower brick; the natural settling of the wall
will hold the lath tight enough to bear any amount of nailing.</p>

<p>For doors and windows, insert pieces same thickness, but large
enough to receive the casings. These thin pieces inserted in the
mortar joints are better and cheaper than plugs or wooden brick,
which are apt to shrink and become loose when the brick-work dries.
It is very important that flues for ventilation and chimneys be properly
started (see “Chimneys”) and carried through the roof to a
height, if possible, above the apex of the roof. Ventilating flues
should run alongside the chimney flues where the construction favors
them. Too much care cannot be taken in building these flues. They
should be carefully and smoothly plastered on the inside, and no
wood-work be allowed nearer than five inches from the inside of flue.
It is customary to use headers (cross bricks) every five courses, to
bind the walls together. Many people object to headers, and prefer
to expose only the edge surface of the brick. This can be done by
clipping the inside courses of outside brick so as to allow the middle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
course to lay angular across the wall, with opposite courses resting
half way between and on the outside courses, or by using square
brick. The latter is a saving of labor if they can be had at a reasonable
price. The thickness of walls depends entirely upon the size of
structure to be built. For ordinary dwelling-houses, twelve inches
is thick enough for outside walls and nine inches for partition walls.
Mortar for brick-work above foundation should be made of one part
of good lime, slacked at time of mixing the mortar, and four parts of
screened sharp sand. The cementing qualities of sand and fresh
lime depend on the purity of the sand. By pure sand we mean that
which is free from loam or clay.</p>

CHARCOAL ROOFING TIN SHINGLES.</h2>

</div>

<p>Our Standard Charcoal Roofing Tin Shingles are made of such
brands as “Mansel,” “Dean,” “Worcester,” “P. T. L.” &amp;c., and
guaranteed to be first-class, well-coated plates, perfect in finish.
Next comes our Galvanized (re-dipped) shingle; this is our Standard
Tin Shingle, taken after it is made and dipped into melted zinc, adding
a second coat of fully twenty pounds on each square, giving with
the tin, a more durable coating than that used on galvanized iron,
making it absolutely rust-proof and saving painting. Next is what
we call “Old Process” or “M. F.” This is what is known as “Old
Style,” “Double-Dipped,” “Old Method,” and other names, but
what is really a very superior article of roofing plate, having a much
heavier coating than “Standard,” but, like it, has to be painted.
There are many brands of practically one quality in the market, and,
having no choice ourselves, we supply the brand preferred; but if the
best is asked for, we send “Old Process,” believing it to be equal

<h2 class="nobreak">THINGS ARE ONLY GOOD OR BAD
BY COMPARISON.</h2>

</div>

<h3><span class="smcap">Walter’s Patent Metallic Shingles Compared with Slate.</span></h3>

<p>Our shingles are not one-sixth the weight of slate, which greatly
reduces the cost of the frame-work of roof. They readily conform
to the shape of a roof, which slate will not do. Slate is not thoroughly
fire-proof, as heat from an adjoining building on fire will
cause the slate to crack, which would destroy the best roof in a few
minutes, leaving the sheeting exposed. Especially is this the case if
water is thrown on them while hot.</p>

<p>Our shingles are free from the many accidents to which slate
roofs are liable, such as cracking from shrinkage of wood-work to
which they are attached; breaking, caused by necessary repairs to
the valleys or chimneys; and the effect of frost on defective slate.
Such defects cannot always be avoided by ordinary observation.
All builders of experience are aware of the expensive repairs necessary
to keep a slate roof in good order, but perhaps the most inconsistent
thing connected with the whole roofing business is the fact
that nineteen-twentieths of all the houses covered with slate <b>have
gutters lined with the same material of which our shingles
are made</b>, while slate was used for covering because of its supposed
durability.</p>

<p>Should anything fall on our shingles it would probably dent
them without causing a break; but should it perforate them, the
shingles can be replaced by another, or a leak can be soldered, and
fire from an adjoining roof cannot more than injure the paint. They
will cool off rapidly, retaining their shape.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Walter’s Patent Tin Shingles Compared with Ordinary
Tin Roofing.</span></h3>

<p>Of this we speak with the advantage of many years’ experience
as practical roofers. The great difficulty metal roofers have to contend
with is contraction and expansion of the metal under the
changes of temperature. This cause alone calls for continued
repairs in all flat lock or standing seam roofs, and the seams underneath
are receptacles for any moisture which may condense on the
underside of the metal. All such roofs first show decay in the cross
seams, and this, while the body of the plates shows no sign of decay.
Our shingles have no cross seam, and are sufficiently ventilated to
prevent condensation of moisture; while a glance at their construction
shows at once that the difficulty caused by contraction and
expansion is successfully overcome. Our shingles do not require
the skilled labor which is necessary to lay the flat lock or standing
groove metal roofing, while the time required to lay a given surface
is much less.</p>

<p>In estimating the difference of cost between the ordinary tin
roofing and our shingle, a steep roof house alone must be taken in
consideration, as our shingle is not proposed for a flat roof. (See
“Comparative Cost,” <a href="#Page_26">pages 26 and 27</a>.)</p>

<p>ROOF PAINT.—We use the best Brown Mineral Oxide of Iron, roasted
and double-ground, mixed with boiled linseed oil, grinding them together,
and adding only enough turpentine to dry in the air in seventy-two hours.
We first dip the shingles, and after they have stood a short time, and before
the paint has set, they are carefully gone over with a brush, insuring an even,
perfect coat, not obtainable in any ordinary way of painting.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<p>All tin roofers, who have experience, know the importance of putting on
a second coat. In spite of the best care in laying, more or less paint is
scratched off, and without a second coat the roof is not finished. Architects
and builders always require it, and if a heavy single coat of paint is given
the roof every five or six years, there will be no perceptible wear on the tin,
insuring many years’ service.</p>

<p>Our Queen Anne Shingles are designed expressly to meet a
want often expressed for an attractive and artistic roof covering and
outside decorating. They are not intended to take the place of our
Standard Walter’s Patent, which for general use are incomparable,
but less ornamental than the Queen Anne Shingles. They have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
bold clean cut lines, producing, from the effects of light and shade,
the most striking and artistic roof yet produced by metallic shingles
or tiles.</p>

<p>For church spires, belt coursing, towers or mansard roofing,
they cannot be excelled. The cut illustrates the kind of finish used
at the eaves and verge board. The same ridge coping used for our
Standard Shingles can be used for this. This shingle must be seen
to be appreciated.</p>

<p>We recommend the Bronze Metal, or the Galvanized Shingles
for use on public or first-class private buildings, because such buildings
should be covered with the best roofing material to be had.</p>

<p>SURFACE MEASURE.—All roofers compute roofing jobs by squares,
which means 100 square feet, or 10 feet square. If you go to your architect
or roofer and ask him how much it will take or cost to cover your roof, he
will first ascertain how many square feet there are to be covered; and if, for
example, there are 2,500 square feet he will tell you there are twenty-five
squares to be covered; and in order to intelligently supply what is wanted,
we put up our shingles in boxes of one square each; that is to say, each box
of one square will cover one hundred square feet after they have been put on.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">OLD MATERIALS.</h2>

</div>

<p>In tearing down old work be as careful as in putting up new.</p>

<p>Old material should never be destroyed simply because it is old.</p>

<p>When putting away old stuff see that it is protected from rain
and the atmosphere.</p>

<p>It costs about 15 per cent. extra to work up old material, and
this fact should be borne in mind, as I have known several contractors
who paid dearly for their “whistle” in estimating on working
up second-hand material.</p>

<p>These remarks apply to wood-work only. In using old bricks,
stone, slate and other miscellaneous materials, it is as well to add
double price for working up.</p>

<p>Workmen do not care to handle old material, and justly so. It
is ruinous to tools, painful to handle, and very destructive to clothing.</p>

<p>In my experience I always found it pay to advance the wages of
workmen—skilled mechanics—while working up old material. This
encouraged the men and spurred them to better efforts.</p>

<p>Sash frames, with sash weights, locks and trim complete, may be
taken out of old buildings that are being taken down and preserved
just as good as new by screwing slats and braces on them, which not
only keeps the frame square, but prevents the glass from being broken.</p>

<p>Doors, frames and trims may also be kept in good order until
used, by taking the same precautions as in window frames.</p>

<p>Old scantlings and joists should have all nails drawn or hammered
in before piling away.</p>

<p>Counters, shelving, drawers and other store-fittings should be
kindly dealt with. They will be wanted sooner or later.</p>

<p>Take care of the locks, hinges, bolts, keys and other hardware.
Each individual piece represents money in a greater or lesser sum.</p>

<p>Old flooring can seldom be utilized, though I have seen it used
for temporary purposes, such as fencing, covering of veranda floors
while finishing work on plastering, etc. As a rule, however, it does
not pay to take it up carefully and preserve it. Conductor pipes,
metallic cornices, and sheet metal work generally, can seldom be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
made available a second time though all is worth caring for, as some
parties may use it for repairs.</p>

<p>Sinks, wash-basins, bath-tubs, traps, heating appliances, grates,
mantels and hearth-stones should be moved with care. They are
always worth money and may be used in many places as substitutes
for more inferior fixings.</p>

<p>Marble mantels require the most careful handling.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most difficult fixings about a house to adapt a
second time are the stairs. Yet I have known where a man has so
managed to put up new buildings that the old stairs taken from
another building just suited. This may have been a “favorable
accident,” but the initiated reader will understand him. Seldom
such accidents can occur.</p>

<p>Rails, balusters and newels may be utilized much readier than
stairs, as the rail may be lengthened or shortened to suit variable
conditions.</p>

<p>Gas fixtures should be cared for and stowed away in some dry
place. They can often be made available, and are not easily renovated
if soiled or tarnished.</p>

<p>It is not wise to employ men who have nothing but their
strength to recommend them. As a rule they are like bears—have
more strength than knowledge, and lack of the latter is often an
expensive desideratum. Employ for taking down the work good
careful mechanics, and do not have the work “rushed through.”
Rushers of this sort are expensive.</p>

<p>Never send old material to a mill to be sawed or planed, no
matter how carefully nails, pebbles and sand have been hunted for,
the saw or planer knives will most assuredly find some you have
overlooked, then there will be trouble at the mill.</p>

<p>Have some mercy for the workman’s tools. If it can be avoided
do not work up old stuff into fine work. If not avoidable pay the
workman something extra because of injury to tools.</p>

<p>Don’t grumble if you do not get as good results from the use of
old material as from new. The workman has much to contend with
while working up old nail-speckled, sand-covered material.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HEATING.</h2>

</div>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 250px;">
<img src="images/illus29.jpg" width="250" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">STEAM AND WARM AIR COMBINED.</p>
</div>

<p>I once knew a church building
committee who planned and built
quite a large church, and when I was
called in to arrange for heating the
building with a large furnace, the
furnace committee were astonished
when told that the building committee
had forgotten the fact that the
hot-air furnace required a chimney.</p>

<p>The construction of many houses
suggests that houses built in the
hot months of summer needed no
special provision for heating. This
is an important subject, and should
be carefully considered in the construction
of the plainest house. Always take climate, location and
fuel into consideration. The open fire place, with fire on the hearth,
is without doubt the most cheerful and healthful. This is the favorite
and best mode for plain country homes. But in all instances, for
churches and public halls, the open fire-place is not to be depended
upon. There is a variety of good steam-heaters and hot-air furnaces
to choose from. Consult the parties from whom you buy as to the
size of heater required; its location, size of cold-air duct, register,
pipe, etc.</p>

<p>For small rural churches that have no basement, construct a
small room under the front entrance or vestibule; eight feet square,
inside measure, is sufficient. Near its floor have a cold-air entrance
leading to the furnace. Cover the opening with wire netting to prevent
the entrance of mice. Use brick for the room, building the
walls eight inches thick; leave openings 2½ × 4 inches, about one foot
apart all around the bottom next to the floor. Carry the wall close to
the ceiling, and make it tight by plastering carefully inside and out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
where it joins the ceiling. Cover the ceiling, by nailing to joists,
with bright sheets of tin, and white-wash the brick-work inside. For
entrance make a door 6 × 3 feet. A plain wooden one will answer.
In the aisle of the church, immediately over this room, put a large
grating, such as your furnace-men will suggest. In this room place
your furnace, and have it <i>large enough</i> to heat the room above during
the coldest weather <i>without excessive firing</i>. With a larger capacity
than necessary, the furnace will last longer, burn less coal, and give
better results in every respect. As the furnace will radiate considerable
heat, this can be utilized by running a pipe of proper size
from the room to the vestibule or some other room. The objection
to using this heat in the church is the noise of firing up, which would
be annoying during church service. However, a furnace properly
attended will not need firing during church service. Remember, a
large volume of <i>warm</i> air is what you want, and <i>not</i> a small volume
of <i>hot</i> air. Never cover the grating or close the cold-air duct to cool
off while there is fire in the furnace, but open the doors or windows
of the church and check the fire. The closing of the grating or
cold-air duct will injure the castings of the furnace by overheating
them.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CLOSE SHEATHING THE BEST.</h2>

</div>

<p>While a rain-proof roof can be made with our shingles, our system,
as well as all metal or slate roofing should not be put upon open
sheathing. If walked upon the metal will not support the weight,
and bends out of shape, and the roof is blamed. In high latitudes
where we have driving storms of fine snow or “blizzards,” <i>we specify
close sheathing covered by paper</i> (<i>using same rules as for laying slate</i>).
We will then guarantee a perfect roof.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">THE CISTERN.</h2>

</div>

<p>Three things are all that are necessary
to supply any family with the
purest and best water in the world
for drinking, cooking and washing
purposes: a well-constructed cistern,
a clean roof and a rain-fall.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 280px;">

</div>

<p>These are within the reach of
every one able to own a home. By
a cistern we mean an excavation in
the earth from twelve to twenty-five
feet deep. Dig deep if you want cold
water all the year round. From eighteen
to twenty-five feet will produce
it. If your cistern is dug in a clayey
soil, there is no use of brick lining;
but if in gravel, sandy or rocky soil,
line the inside with hard, well burnt
brick, and do the work well; using
for mortar equal parts of hydraulic
lime and clean, sharp sand. When completed, plaster the inside carefully
with the same mortar. If the walls are clay plaster immediately
on the sides and bottom, without lining with brick.</p>

<p>No roofing material is better for collecting chemically pure
water than tin, and none so bad as wood shingles. They hold dirt
which no ordinary shower will wash off, and furnish organic matter
which is disagreeable to the taste and smell; the porous nature of
wood makes it the home of myriads of insects, the remains of which
are eventually deposited in the cistern and poison its waters.</p>

<p>No such objections can be urged against tin roofing. A short
shower cleanses it thoroughly. Water-pipes leading into the cistern
in every case should have a cut-off attachment within easy reach.</p>

<p>There are several on the market, but those having no inside
arrangement to get out of order, or obstruct the direct passage of
water into either the cistern or waste-pipe, are the best. The water
should be strained before entering the cistern. This can be built<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
of brick and be underground, or a cask can be used above ground.
A strong, iron-bound linseed oil barrel answers the purpose. Its construction
is very simple. Take out one end of the cask and perforate
it with a sufficient number of one-inch auger holes; lay four
brick on edge in the bottom of the cask, and let the perforated cask
head rest upon them. Then fill the cask three-quarters full of charcoal,
pounding it down on top pretty hard. Put on top of the
charcoal clean, coarse gravel to within three inches of the top of
cask; make a covering with an opening to receive the water which
flows from the roof, and convey the water from the bottom of cask
to the cistern. At least once a year this filter should be emptied
and cleansed, putting in new charcoal and washing the gravel carefully.
Let no summer months’ water run into the cistern. See that
the first rain of a shower is used to wash the dust and soot from
your roof before it is turned into the cistern, and you will have an
abundance of water not equaled by any well or spring.</p>

<p>NEPONSET PAPER is absolutely
water-proof and air-tight, is
clean to handle, not tarred felt, but
far more durable. Its resistance to
air and dampness renders it unsurpassed
under clapboards, iron roofing
and wood or tin shingles.</p>

<p>CLIMAX is a light, clean, pink,
colored paper; useful for any purpose
where building paper is required; is
much cheaper than Neponset, but not
water-proof. The use of building paper
under roofing or clapboards adds
greatly to the ease of warming a
building. By its use you save fuel and
your house is more comfortable. Its
cost is nominal compared with its
advantages. We keep a large stock
and fill orders promptly.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">U. S. Marine Barracks, Navy Yard, Pensacola, Fla.</span>, October 22d, 1887.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sirs</span>:—In compliance with your request, I have to say that about a year
ago I was called upon to decide which of several kinds of roofing material to
select for two barrack buildings, which I was constructing for the Government
at this place. Owing to the heat and moisture of the climate, very destructive
to wood, and the proximity of the Gulf of Mexico, which makes what is known
as a salt atmosphere, very injurious to iron roofing, I was induced to try your
system, and ordered the 14 × 20 size, I. C. Standard, some painted and some
galvanized. As it was previously almost unknown to me, I had to assume
the risk of its success, and have since watched it very closely; the more so, as
it was laid by soldiers entirely unfamiliar with it.</p>

<p>After the first rain a close inspection failed to reveal a single leak. I have
had it inspected after every heavy rain since then with the same result. On
the 20th inst. we had the severest gale for many years, and the roofs not only
resisted it in every way, but there was no rattle, which could not be said of our
other tin roofs (old system).</p>

<p>You can refer any one to me for commendation of these points which are
established; also of its architectural beauty, and I have little doubt as to the
rest, for we painted it very carefully on both sides.</p>

<p>The combination of cherry and light oak proves an excellent

</div>

<p>As you value health,
study well this important
subject, which is oftener
neglected in constructing
dwellings than any other
detail. An experienced
and observant man can
pick from those whom he
meets on the street men or women who habitually sleep in badly
ventilated rooms. The florist will study and practice the best means
to ventilate his propagating house, and ignore the necessity of the
same principle for himself and family. Everything that breathes—and
what living thing does not?—needs a change of air to remain
in a healthy condition. Leaves are the lungs of plants, and, deprived
of this change, soon assume a delicate, sickly hue.</p>

<p>Why should the human family, in full possession of reasoning powers,
ignore the lesson that is every day before them? By ventilation we
mean a system that will constantly supply the dwelling with fresh air;
at the same time it draws the vitiated atmosphere from each hall and
room in the house. This can be done during the process of erection
in a simple, effectual and inexpensive manner. Even if it should cost
more than you feel inclined to pay, the result will justify the expense.</p>

<p>There is no better way of creating upward draught than the
open fire-place, or a flue built with an opening near the floor. Such
flues should not be less than 8 × 8 inches for an ordinary size bedroom,
and should, if possible, be built alongside of the chimney flue,
and extend through the house-top without openings, except the one
nearest the floor in the room it starts from.</p>

<p>As vitiated air is heavier than pure air, and is always nearest the
floor, the artificial draught caused by a long, upright flue is constantly
at work carrying the lower atmosphere from each room in which
these upward and outward draught flues are built. To supply the
rooms with fresh air, corresponding flues must be built similar in size<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
and construction to the above. Commence them with outside openings
about on a level with the first floor joists, extending upward, and end
with openings inward near the ceiling. Each of these openings outside
and inside the house should be covered with coarse wire cloth. That
made from tinned or galvanized No. 16 wire, with one-half in. meshes,
is the best. Care should be taken in building these flues to have them
smoothly plastered on the inside. An ornamental finish can be used at
each end if desired. By this arrangement a steady flow of fresh air,
both night and day, is secured without the ill effects of strong draughts.</p>

<p>Do not try to economize by using one flue for two or more
rooms. Good results are only secured by using a set of flues for each
room or hall. I have seen ventilating flues built to open through the
cornice. That is a bad plan, for even a slight wind will check the
draught while blowing against that side. If the flues are properly
finished after passing through the roof the wind will increase the
draught. The above suggestions answer equally as well for frame
houses. It is easy to construct wood flues between the weatherboarding
and lath.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">COOPER’S CONDUCTOR OR LEADER PIPE.</h2>

</div>

<p>The object of this invention is to supply the builder with a conductor-pipe
that will not burst after freezing, which all pipes without
provision for expansion are liable when water is frozen solid in them.
The peculiarity of the joint lies in the wedge principle, applied in a
manner which forces the rim of the inside lap hard against the
overlapping end with strength sufficient to do without soldering the
joints. Besides this, each joint is provided with a fastening which prevents
the pipe from settling. This fastening may or may not be used,
but if used in connection with the ordinary pipe hook (which does not
prevent the pipe from settling) makes a very superior fastening.</p>

<p>The V-shaped corrugation prevents bursting, as it allows the
pipe to expand when frozen, thus preventing its bursting. We make
two sizes, three and four inches in diameter, twenty-eight inches
long, using tin plate, which we galvanize with zinc after it is formed,
making a pipe superior to any galvanized iron pipe of equal weight.
We make the same not galvanized, but painted one coat inside and
out with linseed oil and oxide of iron paint.</p>

<p>STEEL WIRE BARBED NAILS are superior to any cut nail
made. Are lighter, stronger and easier to drive. Holding firmer
in the wood, and having a larger flat head, they hold the tin to the
roof boards much better, are nearly double the quantity to the
pound, and therefore fully as cheap.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">DEADENING AND FIRE-PROOFING
FLOORS.</h2>

</div>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus44.jpg" width="300" height="150" alt="" />
</div>

<p>This can be accomplished in a simple
and inexpensive manner by nailing strips
1 × 1½ inches along the side of each joist,
the top edge of each strip to be two inches
below the top surface of the joist. On
top of these strips lay a floor of rough boards. Second-hand material
answers every purpose for the floor, as the boards need not be matched
or of even thickness.</p>

<p>On the top of this rough floor spread a covering of coarse
mortar gauged level with the top edge of the joist. When the mortar
is dry lay the floor in the usual manner. It takes a long time for fire
to burn through a floor laid in this manner, and sound is deadened
completely by the mass of non-conducting mortar and the double
floors. For fire-proofing and deadening partitions in an effective
way, build a four-inch brick wall between the studding. A nail
driven every ten or twelve inches in the side of the studding, on the
line of the mortar joint, will hold the wall firmly between the studding.
Where brick is scarce or expensive, sun dried brick made from
stiff clay is a good substitute. They can be made 12 × 12 inches, and
thick enough to come within ⅜ of an inch of the lathing. The mortar
keys impinging against the wall make the plastering firmer and consequently
stronger.</p>

<p>The expense of fire-proofing and deadening in this manner is so
small, it is surprising it is not more generally adopted. If the flooring
is laid before the mortar used between the joists is dry, it will cause
the boards to swell and may bulge them; and when they finally become
dry will leave ugly looking cracks where they join. Remember,
you cannot have a well built house without giving Nature time to do
her work.</p>

WALTER’S PATENT METALLIC SHINGLES.</h2>

</div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">

<p class="caption">Cut I.</p>
<p class="caption">Shows manner of finishing with Climax Ridge Stop Block
and Gable End Finish.</p>
</div>

<p>Commence at the lower
left-hand corner. In
starting be particular
to see that you start
straight with the eaves
of the building. To do
this it is best to draw a
chalk line about twelve
inches from the eaves;
this distance leaves two
inches to project from
the eaves, which in many
cases is more than sufficient.
If you use our
Gable End Finish (Cut
I) it saves the trouble of
fitting the shingles to the
verge board, and adds to the appearance
of the roof. After nailing the
Gable End Finish to its place, press
the left-hand edge of the first shingle
well under the fold of the Gable End
Finish, and before nailing it hook two
or three shingles with the top edge on
a line with your chalk line; then remove
the loose shingles, and nail the
first one which is held to its proper
place by the Gable End Finish. By
doing this in starting each course you
are sure of a straight line if you follow
correctly the gauge lines at the top of
each shingle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 300px;">

<p class="caption">Cut A.</p>
<p class="caption">Shows commencement of first two courses.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span></p>

<p>If your roof has a <b>pitch of six inches to the foot, or steeper, let the
bottom edge of the shingle rest just above the lower gauge line on the top of
the underlying shingle, as shown in Cut A</b>. But if the pitch of the roof is
less than six inches to the foot,
let the shingle entirely cover the
lower gauge line, as shown in
Cut B.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illus47.jpg" width="350" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Cut B.</p>
</div>

<p>We advise against the use
of our shingles on roofs of less
pitch than five inches to the
foot, unless the lap is increased.
As a rule, we think any roof that
can be walked over with safety
is too flat for shingles of either wood
or metal.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 325px;">
<img src="images/illus48.jpg" width="325" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Cut F.</p>
</div>

<p>Should there be a gutter formed
at the eave, let the shingle
rest on it as you would in
using the ordinary wood
shingle. (Remember
every other course <b>commences
with a half shingle,
as shown in Cuts A
and B</b>.) The same rules
that govern the laying
of slate or the common
wood shingle along valleys,
or about chimneys
and dormer windows,
are applicable to ours, except the tin shingles are bent up against the
sides of chimneys, which cannot be done with wood or slate. When<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
our shingles turn up against the sides of chimneys or brick walls, insert
flashing by sawing out the mortar joint above the line of tin
work; where the upper edge of our shingles butts against the brick
wall, as they do on the lower side of chimneys, cut them off on the
line where the chimney comes to the roof, and use a strip of tin bent
in this manner. (See Cut F.) The upper end at A is to fit in mortar
joint. The lower edge, B, is nailed to the sheathing before the
shingles are put on. The upper ends of shingles are then to be
pressed up under the fold, C. Great care should be used in finishing
about chimneys and dormers, the details
of which cannot well be explained to suit
each case; but a workman of ordinary
skill can suggest the
proper manner in which
the work should be done
to secure thoroughly
tight work.</p>

<p>It is much easier to
secure this result with
the use of our shingles
than it is with either
wood or slate.</p>

<p>Where the upper end of shingle butts
against the side of a frame house, use
the same means as on the lower side of
chimneys, only let there be no bend at the point A, as shown in Cut
F; but let it extend an inch or so up under the weather boarding.
Where the weather boarding is vertical there is no way of making tight
work but to put the tin work, as before described, back of the vertical
weather board.</p>

<p>In laying the valley, cut the tin so it extends to about one-half
inch over the lock, and bend it under, as shown in Cut D. We furnish
to each customer a small pair of hand-tongs, which is handy to
turn this edge over and pinch it together after the shingle is laid.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus49.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Cut D.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>The Cut D represents the shingles laid to and from the valley.
In starting from the valley it is best to hold several shingles together,
or tack them at the top, then with a straight-edge mark and
cut where they overlap the valley; and with the hand-tongs edge and
lock them to the valley, as shown in cut D.</p>

<p>Use the Hip Coping by nailing the edges to the roof boards, and
press the shingle up under the folds on each side after they are cut
to suit the angle of the hip. (See Cut E.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illus50.jpg" width="400" height="350" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Cut E.</p>
</div>

<p>As plain as this appears, we have known men to nail the Hip
Coping through the folds and on the top of the shingles. We are,
therefore, particular to
say wherever this Hip,
or our Plain Ridge Coping
(which is the same
thing) is used it should
be nailed to the roof
boards before the shingles
are put on. The
fold is made expressly
to receive the edge of
the shingles. Cut E
shows this coping and
the manner of applying
it.</p>

<p>We desire to impress upon our customers, who live in the Northern
States, where blizzards and severe snow storms are frequent,
the necessity of using close sheathing, and if the sheathing is not
close, <b>the use of sheathing paper, to be laid underneath the shingles</b>; it adds
greatly to the warmth of the house in winter, and prevents small particles
of snow from entering, it costs but little, and should always be
used under wood, slate or tin shingles where the best protection is
desired.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">PAINTING.</h2>

</div>

<p>After the mason, bricklayer, carpenter, tinsmith and plasterer
comes the painter. At this stage of progress in the work, the owner
usually thinks of moving in; in fact, he thinks he should have been
living in his new house several weeks ago.</p>

<p>If weather conditions have been good, the representatives of
other branches of house building have got along smoothly excepting
a little shaking up now and then, caused mostly by the men occasionally
yielding to the seductive influences of Old John Barleycorn or
his rival King Growler. The owner, having previously engaged or
contracted for inside painting, now calls on the painter. The man
of colors and brushes is always ready to promise quick work (and
we are free to say the mysteries of his trade are equal to any reasonable
emergency), and is apt to humor his employer’s impatience, and
meekly submits to his wishes knowing that his employer’s hurry is
his gain. House-builder, did it ever occur to you that first-class
inside painting is a slow process? Think of this; after the first
coat is laid, it should stand long enough to become thoroughly dry,
dry enough to be sand-papered. The second coat should be a little
heavier than the first or priming coat. It does not dry as fast as the
first. (We are speaking of good materials properly proportioned.)
Each coat must be thoroughly dry before it is sand-papered. Any
kind of good work requires three coats. Extra good work—four,
besides varnishing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>If you succeed in doing this work inside of four weeks you are
fortunate. Thus you see it requires time to do good work. Time
for the men to do theirs, and time for Nature to do hers. Sometimes
Nature frowns and lowers a curtain of humidity for days at a time,
which prevents the oils from drying. It is possible for your painter
to finish all four coats in as many days; but if he is honest and you
have not hurried him unreasonably, his conscience will suffer. Good
painting, like other good things, is durable, looks well, and is the
cheapest in the end.</p>

<p>Good painters pride themselves on doing good work. So if you
desire first-class work, you should give the painter a reasonable price,
and sufficient time in which to do the work properly.</p>

<p>There is doubtless more adulteration in paint than in any
materials used in house-finishing. So general is this the case that it
is often difficult to get pure materials. This is caused by the low
price of the products of petroleum, the earth materials used to adulterate
mineral paints, and the demand for cheap work.</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<h2 class="nobreak">ATTENTION, ROOFERS!</h2>

<p>Our <span class="smcap">Broad Rib Roofing</span> and <span class="smcap">Steel Plate Shingles</span> are not
protected with a coat of richer metal like those made of tin or terne
plate, and consequently their <i>durability depends upon the paint</i> with
which they should be covered.</p>

<p>For this purpose nothing, so far as we know, is equal to a mixture
of <i>pure unboiled linseed oil</i> and the <i>oxide of iron</i>. The Shingles
should have two coats, one before they are put on, on both sides
(this we do), the other immediately <i>after they are laid</i>. This last
coat should be repeated <i>every four or five years</i>.</p>

<p>Remember, it is the <i>rust-preventing</i> qualities of linseed oil, combined
with the oxide of iron, that makes steel or iron sheets resist the
corrosive action of oxygen, which is ever present in the atmosphere.

<h2 class="nobreak">WHAT OUR GOODS ARE.</h2>

</div>

<p>In offering our goods to the public, we desire to say, briefly,
that the <i>Walter’s Patent Metallic Shingles and Siding Plates</i> have
now been before this country for nearly eight years, upwards of twelve
thousand buildings have been covered with them in the United
States and Canada, and we feel warranted in referring to the owners
of every building so covered.</p>

<p>Our shingles have a concealed nailing flange the entire length
of the shingle on one side, and a perfect lock with a concealed gutter
at the side of the nailing flange that provides for <i>expansion and
contraction</i>, with sufficient ventilation to prevent sweating on the
under-side, (causing rust,) so common in the cross seams of flat lock
and standing seam, now in use.</p>

<p>Our Galvanized (Re-dipped) Shingle is our Standard Tin
Shingle galvanized; and, as every square has twenty pounds of
zinc coating, in addition to the first coat of tin, it will be seen why
it is superior to any galvanized iron made.</p>

<p>Our “Old Process” prices are designed to cover such grades of
double-coated plates as “Old Style,” “M.F.,” “Phelp’s Triple Plate,”
“Gilbertson’s Old Method,” and “Tregoning Old Process,” all superior
to the Standard Grades, and higher in price. We quote all but
Galvanized, painted both sides. If any size or kind is ordered unpainted,
the price will be 25 cents per square less.</p>

<p>Our Steel Plate Shingles are made from sheets of Bessemer steel
rolled as smooth as tin plate, they are painted the same as the Standard
Shingles, and when laid on a roof cannot be distinguished from
them. They should be painted every five years with pure linseed oil
and oxide of iron (brown mineral). They will not bear neglect; in
this respect they differ from shingles made from tin plate. The price
is somewhat less, but the greater durability of the Tin Shingles is
worth more than the difference in price.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>We make our shingles in four sizes: The smallest, 7 × 10, (showing
an exposed surface, after laid, of 5½ × 9 inches,) is designed for
Mansards, Spires, Siding, and other upright work. The 10 × 14, (exposed
surface, 8¼ × 11½ inches,) is the popular size; and while it
works to the best advantage on complicated roofs, it is equally good
for plain ones. The 14 × 20, (exposed surface, 12 × 17½ inches,) is
used largely on the plainer roofs, where a saving in price and labor
of putting on is an item. The 20 × 28, (exposed surface, 17½ × 25½
inches,) is made from heavier metal, and is designed for warehouses,
and other large surfaces; and any of the larger shingles can be used
for siding equally as well.</p>

<p>We are prepared to make any of the above sizes from any special
brand of tin plate in the market, but for our Standard goods,
which we carry in stock, we use a first-class grade of roofing tin
plate, warranted perfect.</p>

<h3>SAMPLES.</h3>

<p>We will send free, and charges paid, samples of our <span class="smcap">Walter’s
Patent Shingles</span> (three pieces) to any address in the United States
on receipt of five two-cent stamps; this does not pay us one-half the
expense, but we propose to make the cost as light as possible to those
interested in building.</p>

<div class="figleft">
<img src="images/illus52.jpg" width="400" height="400" alt="" />
</div>

<p><b>Like Our Shingles</b>, has
a nailing flange the entire
length of each sheet. <b>It
forms a Continuous Rib</b>
when applied from eaves
to comb with cross seams
twenty-five inches apart,
which gives it strength and
rigidity not found in roofing
where longer sheets are
used. <b>It has no protruding</b>
anchors, cleats or rivets;
all nail heads are covered
as perfectly as those
used for wood shingles.
<b>There is no waste</b> in using,
either at comb or eaves.
<b>The Side Nailing Flange</b>
admits of the roof being
fastened to roof boards
with any required degree
of strength. <b>The Cross
Seams</b> are formed with a folded lock which allows for contraction and expansion.
<b>Material.</b>—Each sheet of this roofing is made from Best Roofing Tin, or Imported
Siemen’s Sheet Steel, which is hard rolled, tough, durable and <b>thoroughly
coated</b> on both sides with the best Oxide of Iron and Linseed Oil Paint. The
size of sheets are 20 × 28 inches. <b>Tools.</b>—We send with each order one pair of
<i>Metal Shears</i>, one <i>Mallet</i>, and a <i>Draw Tool</i>, for which we make a charge of two
dollars. These tools can be returned to us by express at our expense, and the
purchaser credited, or the money paid for them returned. <b>Important Improvements</b>
in the manufacture of Steel Sheets enable us to put this on the
market at the same price as Sheet Iron Roofing, to which it is greatly superior.
<b>The Rib is formed</b> of the Walter’s Patent Lock, and is the same we have
used on our shingles for the last
seven years. This Lock has been
thoroughly tested, and it is significant
that over 25,000,000 square
feet of shingles constructed upon
this plan are already in use in the
United States and Canada. The
application of this Lock does away
with a very large proportion of the
work necessary in laying standing
seam roofs as ordinarily applied,
such as tonging up the seams, double seaming, capping or riveting the ribs, and
making and using cleats or other fastenings. This roofing costs no more than
wood shingles in sections where good timber is scarce. Each sheet is made
from plates 20 × 28 inches. <b>WRITE FOR PRICES.</b></p>

</div>

<div class="figleft">

<p>This is a novelty in

the advantage of
admitting light as well as
ventilating rooms in the
garret or immediately under
the roof.</p>

<p>It can be used on any kind of a slope roof having a pitch of
three inches or more to the foot. The front is of double strength
glass which is held to its place by a single catch. When used as a
ventilator the glass is drawn back to the slant of the roof, and sheds
what water would enter the opening during a rain storm. All the
carpenter work necessary in setting the “Attic” is to saw a square
hole through the roof boards at the time of putting on the roof-covering.
We make them to form one plate of our Broad Rib Roofing
with which it interlocks. As shown on <a href="#Page_55">page 55</a>, they can be
used equally as well on roofs to be covered with slate or wood
shingles as with our Tin Shingles.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">HOW METAL SHINGLES ARE MADE.</h2>

</div>

<p>Shingles made from wood have been common all over the world
for ages. Their particular form has remained unchanged because
many years’ experience has proven it to be the most durable and surest
safe-guard against storms. What is true of wood for roof covering is
equally true of metal for the same purpose. The first metal roofing
made in America was tin sheets, laid shingle fashion, the overlapped
edges of which covered the nail heads which were used to fasten
them to the roof boards. Many of these old-fashioned metal (tin
plate) roofs are yet in existence that were covered over one hundred
years ago. The writer covered several houses in 1849 in this manner,
which are in good condition now. The reason why this style of metal
roofing was not common was its expense. On <a href="#Page_16">page 16</a> we give
reasons why it would be more durable than the ordinary mode of
laying tin roofing.</p>

<p>The use of Walter’s and Cooper’s patent in constructing metal
shingles does away with the expense, which was a great drawback to
their use, and leaves no excuse for the use of cheap, combustible
material.</p>

<p>The National Sheet Metal Roofing Co., of New York City, have
for the past eight years been manufacturing these shingles, and their
use on a vast number of public and private buildings in all parts of
the United States and Canada attest their superiority. Thinking
that our readers would be pleased to see the process of making
these shingles, we illustrate on <a href="#Page_65">pages 65</a> and <a href="#Page_75">75</a> views taken from
photographs of their paint and store room. The process requires
two press operations for each shingle, and each press averages a
turn out of 4,000 square feet (which is 40 squares) per day. The
dies which give shape and form the corrugations of the shingles
are faced with polished steel, which leaves no abrasions where they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
come in contact with the metal. During the past year they have
added four new presses to this department to meet the requirements
of the increased demand for their goods. They spare no pains to
make their shingles as perfect as the best machinery can make them.
All their shingles are carefully inspected before they are boxed and
sent to the store room, from which they are shipped to all parts of
the country. The machinery room in which the presses are located
is 37 feet wide by 80 feet long, the painting department is 80 × 55
feet, and the store room the same size. We give these figures that
you may form an opinion of the space required to manufacture and
handle their goods.</p>

<p>The process of painting is first dipping the shingles in a vat of
pure linseed oil and oxide of iron paint with just enough turpentine
to assist in drying. They are then set on edge and left to drain,
after which they are gone over with a brush and set in racks to dry,
which requires several days, according to the humidity of the atmosphere.
They are all air dried, no artificial heat being used. Their
customers are cordially invited to call at any time and see the process
of manufacturing.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">INSIDE CONSTRUCTION.</h2>

</div>

<p>By this we do not mean the arrangement or size of rooms, they
may be large or very small, and in either instance lack the conveniences
which may always be provided for by good construction. Even
a small house can have transoms over all the doors which open into
a hall, proper ventilating flues for all rooms, and a kitchen that will
be comfortable in all seasons, (see articles under the head of “Ventilation”
and “The Kitchen.”) These are essential; all dwellings, large or
small, should have them. The windows and doors should be arranged
to suit the furniture to be used. You have doubtless seen rooms with
windows on two sides, a door and fire-place on the other. This
arrangement makes it impossible for the room to contain an ordinary
size bedstead, without placing it before a window or some other
opening. Study these things when getting up plans for your house.</p>

<p>The dining room should be light and roomy, fronting the East
if possible, as the morning sun is always desirable, and adds much
to the cheerfulness of the family. The kitchen should not connect
directly with the dining-room. Construct a passage-way, well ventilated,
between the two rooms; this will prevent unsavory odors entering
the dining-room. The space at each end of the passage can be
utilized for the kitchen closets. Arrange your rooms so that you
will not be compelled to pass through one room to get to another.
Do not disfigure the walls by driving nails or hooks into the plastering
for the purpose of hanging pictures, but fasten a neat gilt moulding
to the side walls all around the room, about one foot from the
ceiling. The moulding should be about one and one-half or two
inches wide, with a groove on its upper side. Hooks shaped as an S
can be placed at any point on this moulding, and the pictures are to
be hung to these hooks. This arrangement is somewhat expensive,
but it is the only proper way in which pictures can be hung.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>Closets.—No house is complete without ample closets. Every
lady knows that clothing and wraps cannot be stored away in drawers,
and look well when wanted for use. As closets are expensive we
suggest for small houses, that a room be constructed from four to six
feet wide, and from ten to fifteen feet long, with a window at one
end. Make shelves on one side, and place suitable clothes hooks on
the other. In such a room the entire wardrobe and family linen can
be properly stored. If you desire a moth-proof room, the ceiling,
walls and shelves should be made of red cedar. We suggest this
clothes room because of its cheapness. Each bedroom of large houses
should be provided with a clothes closet, which should be lined with
red cedar for the reasons above stated.</p>

<p>Don’t forget to have windows and all outside doors fitted up
with light sash and frames covered with woven wire cloth. This
material is very cheap, and can be purchased at any house-furnishing
goods store. Its use prevents mosquitoes and flies from entering the
house. Freedom from these summer pests will amply repay you for
the expense. During the late fall, winter and spring months, the
sash and frames can be removed; they should be stored in some perfectly
dry place, such as a garret, never in a cellar. Speaking of
pests reminds us of another kind that breed in cracks and crevices
found in most kitchens, which might lead a thoughtful man to suppose
that the builder, in his kindness of heart, provided these little
hiding places for just such creatures. If you don’t want them, see
that there are no cracks left between the wood-work and plastering,
or in any part of the floor or walls of the kitchen. Fill with cement
(Plaster of Paris is good) all cracks caused by shrinkage of wood-work
after the walls are completed and are thoroughly dry.</p>

<h3>GUTTERS, VALLEYS AND DOWN PIPES.</h3>

<p>These things are very closely related to the roof, and like it
should be of the best material.</p>

<p>A tin gutter hung at the eaves has the advantage of being cheap;
if made of good material and put up with good fastenings is durable,
and suitable for cheap houses and some portions of expensive ones.</p>

<p>In all cases where the fastenings are to hang from the roof, the
gutter should be put up before the roof covering is put on, so the
fastenings can be secured to the roof boards instead of on top of the
tin, slate or wood shingles. If the fastenings are nailed on top of the
roof covering, the nails soon become loose, and the gutter sags. The
tinsmith will charge no more for doing his work before the roofers
commence, but it may delay you a day. Paint the gutter inside as well
as out, and see that it has sufficient fall to clear itself of water. If you
prefer the gutter on the roof near the eaves, let the sheets of which it
is made be of sufficient width to extend far enough up under the
roof covering to prevent water (when the gutter is full) from overflowing
at the back instead of over at the front; this is a common
error. In every instance let this top gutter be outside the wall line,
so in case of leakage the “drip” is outside the walls. Gutters of
this kind, and all gutters that are soldered and firmly fastened to roof
boards (not hanging gutters), are liable to crack by expansion and
contraction of the metal; we therefore say, never put a gutter inside
the wall lines if they can be put outside. Valleys formed by the
joining of two roofs at an angle are usually steep enough to allow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
the metal sheets to lap on each other and shed water without soldering.
Such sheets are usually made twenty-eight inches long. Their
shortness prevents cracking from expansion and contraction even if
nailed to roof boards. Remember that all trash or dirt that settles
on the roof eventually finds its way into the valleys, gutters and
down pipes, and in a manner scours their surface; for this reason
they receive several fold more wear than the same amount of
exposed surface of the roof, consequently, should be of better
material. Few people are aware of the amount of dirt and sand
which is carried by the wind and deposited on their house-tops; for
this reason, if the water is used for drinking or cooking purposes, the
first water that flows from the roof during a rain storm should not be
allowed to flow into the cistern.</p>

<p>It is always best to have good sized down pipes. As a rule, for
down pipes from hanging gutters, let the circumference of the pipe
equal the girt of the gutter, and the gutter should be large enough
to convey the water which falls on the roof during the heaviest
storms. Use only curved elbows where a turn in the pipe is to be
made, and at the foot or discharge end. Curved elbows are now made
by machinery; they are stronger, more durable and cost no more
than the common hand-made acute kind.</p>

<p>We have spoken of good material; but what is good material
when Tin Plate is spoken of? The quality of Tin Plate depends on
its toughness, and the weight of Tin or Terne coating on its surface.
The first is easily determined by bending back and forth with the
hand, the latter is not, unless handled by an expert. The following
test will determine the difference, provided you have different qualities.
If the qualities are the same, or nearly so, the difference will
not be distinguishable.</p>

<p>Take two pieces of different quality of Tin or Terne plates, say
two inches square, grease one side with any kind of animal fat; then
with a pair of plyers, hold them separately over a gas or candle jet
with one corner obliquely downward, and the amount of fusible
metal which flows from them will determine the difference between
good and common.</p>

The writer has his house covered with the Galvanized Tin Shingles, and

and have never had any fault found with them of all the roofs that I have put

it the best tin roofing they have ever seen. It is <i>the</i> roof for me when I am

durable as any tin roof can possibly be. I have watched it during every rainstorm
since it was laid, and not one drop has passed through it to my gratification,

<p>Gentlemen:—I have been in the tin roofing business for the past 20 years,
and I believe that the Walter’s Patent Tin Shingles make the best tin roofing
of any of the other patents that are now on the market. I have put on hundreds
of squares of them, and they have given me and the property owners
entire satisfaction. I will further say that each box of shingles I have bought
from them has covered one hundred square feet of roof, which will be understood
by tinners to be a great satisfaction in ordering roofing, as the rule is
that patent roofing falls short after being laid. I have often been asked by
different manufacturing companies for my opinion of the roofing that they
manufacture, but this is the first time that I have ever given my opinion, and
I would not give my opinion now if the Walter’s Patent Tin Shingles did
not deserve it.</p>

<p>Gentlemen:—Having Walter’s Metal Shingles on two of my buildings,
put on by F. H. Hodge, the new <i>Courier</i> building being sided with them, I
feel that I am competent to speak of the merits of the shingles. My experience
has been entirely satisfactory, and I regard the Metallic Shingles as the
best roofing and siding extant. If I were to build a hundred houses, and it
were possible to use these shingles, I would not hesitate one moment, as I
regard them as cheaper and better than any other covering in the market.</p>

<p>Gentlemen:—It affords me much pleasure to indorse favorably the Walter’s
Patent Metallic Shingles. I have used them on our church buildings in Trinidad,
Colo., Albuquerque, N. M., and Woodstock, Md. In the first named
place they have been in use over two years, and have withstood, without detriment,
the very high winds and occasional driving storms of rain and snow for
which that State is so remarkable. In the other places they are also giving satisfaction
in every respect.</p>

<p>I consider a roof of this material far superior to the ordinary tin or iron,
both in beauty of design and solidity of construction, and see no reason why it
should not supersede slate, as it is far less costly, requires a lighter frame, is
just as much fire or storm-proof, and equally durable if kept painted.</p>

scaffolding was left on the different roofs, more for a test from banking of snow
and back-water, feeling assured that if the shingles survived the test, I would
never experience any trouble from that source, in the future, when the scaffolding
was removed. I was more than satisfied with the test, as we experienced
no trouble from leakage or from any other source. Therefore, I take great
